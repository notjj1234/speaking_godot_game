## 📖 About The Project

Loqui Quest is a 2D topdown RPG game that combines JRPG combat with language learning via speech mechanics. This game heavily inspired by games we all know and love such as **Zelda**, **Dragon Quest** and **Final Fantasy**

> Assets courtesy of [Michael Games](https://michaelgames.itch.io/2d-action-adventure-rpg-assets).
> Cannot thank him enough for making these assets free to use. This personal project of mine would never have started if not for him.

**Main Features:**
- 🎙️ **Speech Challenge**: Use microphone to defeat enemies by passing several speech tests.
- 🧠 **Word Counter**: Track how many times you’ve said each word.
- 🕹️ **Mic-Only Mode**: Use your voice to move and attack — Used for those who are lazy or during level specific challenges 👀.
- 📋 **Word List Menu**: Review all spoken words/sentences in the pause menu.
- ☁️ **Google Sheets Integration**: Spoken words are logged for tracking. I use Google Sheets because its free and accessible everywhere on the internet. Sue me for being broke lol.

**Supported OS:**
- Windows OS
- Android OS

**Unsupported OS:**
- iOS/Mac OS
- Web Based (Trying to work on this. Primary focus)
