## üìñ About The Project

Loqui Quest is a 2D topdown RPG game that combines JRPG combat with language learning via speech mechanics. This is game heavily inspired by games we all know and love such as **Zelda**, **Dragon Quest** and **Final Fantasy**

I started this as a learning Godot project at first and it ended up spiraling into this rabbit hole of watching YouTube tutorials and stuff lol.

> Cannot thank him enough for making these assets free to use. This personal project of mine would never have started if not for him.

Original sprites will come later once the core gameplay is finished! (Or when I actually learn how to draw lol)

**Main Features:**
- üéôÔ∏è **Speech Challenge**: Use microphone to defeat enemies by passing several speech tests.
- üß† **Word Counter**: Track how many times you‚Äôve said each word.
- üïπÔ∏è **Mic-Only Mode**: Use your voice to move and attack ‚Äî Used for those who are lazy or during level specific challenges üëÄ.
- üìã **Word List Menu**: Review all spoken words/sentences in the pause menu.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Google Sheets Integration**: Spoken words are logged for tracking. I use Google Sheets because its free and accessible everywhere on the internet. Sue me for being broke lol.

**Supported OS:**
- Windows
- Android

**Unsupported OS:**
- iOS/Mac OS (Thank you Apple for making everything expensive)
- Web Based (Trying to work on this. Primary focus)
